# ✨ Ujwal R's Contribution – Light Mode & UI Components

Hi there! I'm **Ujwal R**, and this is my contribution to our collaborative Student Club Website project. Our goal as a team of four students was to create a clean, modern, and responsive interface — and my part focused on the **Light Mode styling** and a set of **interactive UI components** using CSS.

## 🌞 What I Worked On

I handled the styles that make the website feel light, vibrant, and user-friendly. Here's a breakdown of the features I built:

### 🎨 Light Mode Support
- Designed a full **light theme** using the `.light-mode` class.
- Ensured all components remain accessible and visually pleasing on light backgrounds.

### 🔘 Button Variants
- Created reusable button styles:
  - `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-outline`, and `.btn-ghost`
- Added hover animations and smooth transitions for interaction feedback.

### 📋 Form States
- Styled inputs with `.success`, `.error`, and `:disabled` states.
- Helps users quickly understand the validation status of form fields.

### 🔼 Scroll-to-Top Button
- Added a neat, floating button that appears as users scroll.
- Includes hover effects and auto-hide behavior.

### 🧰 Utility Classes
- Simple helper classes like `.mt-2`, `.text-center`, `.p-2` for faster layout control.

### 🎚 Custom Scrollbars
- Gave scrollbars a more polished look to match the rest of the UI.

### 💬 Tooltip Styling
- Made tooltips that fade in smoothly on hover, using pure CSS.

### 🏷 Badge Styles
- Implemented color-coded labels for tags, statuses, or roles.

### 🔄 CSS Loader
- Designed a lightweight, animated loading spinner using `@keyframes`.

### 🧱 Sponsors Grid
- A responsive grid layout to showcase sponsor logos.

### 📢 Announcements Box
- Informative section with styled highlights for club updates.

### ❓ FAQ Accordion
- Interactive question & answer blocks that expand and collapse on click.
